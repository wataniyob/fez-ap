/*
 * This patch fixes a softlock which occurs if any Dot dialogue starts while the camera is spiraling down. This bug is
 * possible to encounter in the vanilla game, but it is even more important for FEZAP since you can be sent Emotional
 * Support at any time. This patch delays the Dot text from appearing until after the camera spiral animation is done.
 *
 * The method we need to patch is inside a delegate with a compiler-generated name which can be different on different
 * platforms or even different compilations. We scan for the method by its signature which should be solid. Worst case,
 * if we don't find it, bail instead of crashing the mod (I think it should always find it).
