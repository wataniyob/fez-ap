# Fez AP ![thumbnail](icon.png)

## Overview

This is a [HAT](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) mod which adds archipelago multiworld randomizer support to FEZ.
It is heavily based on the wonderful [FEZUG](https://github.com/FEZModding/FEZUG).

## Details

Every collectible is a location check to send, but the clock anti-cubes can be disabled through the option `shuffle_clock_antis: false`. Progression items sent are golden cubes, anti-cubes and door unlocks. The golden and anti-cubes are not distinct so you hint for a general "next cube of type". Door unlocks are are a replacement for keys with 4 additional locked doors added to balance sphere sizes. These doors are:

- Nature Hub -> Arch
- Nature Hub -> Bell Tower
- Tree -> Cabin Interior B
- Tree Sky -> Throne

In addition to the progression items, every treasure map, artifact, heart cube and the first-person sunglasses is also an item that can be sent. There is no game logic tied to them except for if the knowledge logic option is enabled with `knowledge_logic: true`. This is since you can look up the codes/invisible platforms online or remember them from a previous run. The brute forced black monolith code can be found in-game now if you want to go for the full knowledge logic experience.

The remaining space in the item pool is filled with traps and filler with a ratio depending on the options `trap_percentage` and `trap_weights`. Thee traps are:

- **Rotation Trap**: forcefully rotates your screen
- (Currently disabled) ~~**Reload Trap**: reloads the current level sending you to the entrance~~
- (Currently disabled) ~~**Gravity Trap**: quadruples gravity for 15 seconds~~

## Installing

- Follow the instructions to setup HAT.
  - **Fez AP is currently incompatible with the latest HAT release, please use [HAT v1.2.1](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT/releases/tag/v1.2.1).**
- Download the latest `FezAP.zip` from the releases tab and place it in your `Mods` folder.
- If all is well, when running `MONOMODDED_FEZ.exe`, you should see the HAT logo and the FEZAP version in the top left.

## Usage

- Create and open a new save (you can backup your old saves by copying their save files from your local files).
  - If you are reconnecting to an existing AP game, just load into it's save file.
- Press \` and use the `connect` command (if you type `help` followed by any command you can get more info).
  - The command to input is of the form: `connect <server> <port_number> <slot_name> <optional: password>`
  - Example: `connect archipelago.gg 12345 My_Fez`
- Everything should be fine if you see `Connected` in the top left of the screen.
- There are no checks until you go outside with the Fez, so you can do the intro sequence before the countdown.
- There are several other handy commands you can use like `ready`, `say`, `missing`, `received` and many quality of life ones ported over from FEZUG.
- There are several utility commands like `collect`, `send`, `warp`, `tp` and `itemcount`, but they should only be used to get out of softlocks or other problems while this mod is not fully stable.
- If you disconnect, don't open any locked doors (both key and cube count doors).
- It is recommended to look up codes for anti-cubes and heart cubes online while the poptracker doesn't exist.
- Handy tools that may help can be found here: <https://jenna1337.github.io/FezTools/>
- Check the [TODO list](TODO.md) for a list of known bugs and future plans.
- Check the pinned spreadsheet on the AP discord server's Fez thread for codes and bug workarounds.

## Building

- You need clone this repo and have dotnet installed and configured.
- You need to find the folder where you have Fez installed.
- You need to have [HAT](https://github.com/FEZModding/HAT) installed and confirmed to work.
- Copy `UserProperties.xml.template` into `UserProperties.xml`
  - Configure `FezDir` to point to your FEZ installation with HAT installed, e.g. `C:\Games\FEZ` or `/home/user/Games/FEZ`
  - If necessary, configure `MonoModDir` and  `ModOutputDir` properties if they're not as expected (they should be as expected)
- Run `dotnet build` from the root directory to build the mod and copy over all the files into your mod directory.
- Run `HAT.exe` to confirm that HAT sees the mod and just test that things seem to work.
- For apworld development, modify the files in `Archipelago/worlds/fez`.
